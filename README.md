##### What is it?
A JavaScript-based Legend of Zelda clone. We weren't sure what to make, and wanted a project, so I guess we're trying this now? We'll see how it goes.

##### Why's it called that?
Because GitHub recommended that repo name, and it was beautiful.

##### How do I play it?
Well, it doesn't really exist yet, so good luck with that. Maybe once it vaguely exists we'll set up a website to pull from master, and you could play it there.
